- Run `yarn libdev` in root folder.

### To update library code and develop your web version
- Run `yarn libdev` and `yarn webdev` this is make sure your changes are reflected in realtime when you change code in library

### To update library code and develop your android version
- Run `yarn libdev` and `yarn androiddev` this is make sure your changes are reflected in realtime when you change code in library

> to develop android code we have to make a symlink from library to android folder.

`npm install -g wml`.
`wml add ./packages/common ./packages/nativeapp/node_modules/monoreactrepo`
`wml start`.

> now you will updated code everytime you change something in library code.
